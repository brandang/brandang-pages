    "what digit the blob most likely was.    It works reasonably well for most numbers. However, I had to solve many issues to get" +
    "it working. Firstly, the dataset was handwritten digits, but peoples writting using a mouse is slightly different, leading" +
    "to some classification errors. Identification of the digits 6 and 1 were especially error-prone. However, I manually wrote down" +
    "about a dozen digits to add to the dataset, and it solved most of these issues.   Limitations there must be some space between" +
